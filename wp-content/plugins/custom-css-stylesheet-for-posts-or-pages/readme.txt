Adds any number of extra fields in any number of additional boxes on the Write/Edit page in the Admin.

== Description ==

** Child themes are now supported **
Custom CSS let's you include a custom css file per post/page. You have your main style.css but let's say in one post you want a few things different. Instead of polluting your main stylesheet, you can include a new one with just the styles that you need for this specific post/page.

How to do it:

* Create your css file and save it in a folder called "custom-css" within your theme's folder (/themename/custom-css).
* Every stylesheet in this folder will appear in the Add/Edit Post screen in a dropdown menu for you to select the one that you need.

== Installation ==

To install Custom CSS:

1. Upload the 'custom_css' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. In the add/edit post/page select your custom css stylesheet. Enjoy
